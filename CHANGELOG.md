# Changelog

## 2.2.2

- fix: Approval view for a special situation had been throwing an error. Issue with "Call to a member function setTotalDuration() on null" which could occur when timesheets are available on Sunday spanning through Monday and by chance are documented for the "day" as Monday, not Sunday. This is now fixed by checking if the day is not available in the week, then use the previsous day (Sunday).

- fix: "History" of approvals had not been shown
- fix: When timesheets are not all finished (e.g. no end-time), the approval view had an error and was not showing up

## 2.2.0

- **API endpoints changed** to support Kimai naming conventions
- All API endpoints contain additionally "/approval-bundle/" in as prefix - this is a breaking change, so if you have integrations, you need to update them - the "TimeKex" integration has been updated - use the latest release and update the configuration

## 2.1.4

- fix: Break issue calculations had not been correct, when time entries had been in misorder, e.g. entered later times before earlier times, this is now fixed.
